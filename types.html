                    <p>It’s no secret that we love a good red. And we’re clearly not alone, with billions of us across the world filling our glasses and racks with red wine every year. There are, in fact, well over 50 different types of red wine out there to explore and enjoy, ranging from rich, powerful palates to lighter, more fruit-driven styles.</p>
                    <p>There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to red wine as there are so many factors to consider, including taste, occasion and price.</p>

                        <p>When choosing a red wine type, understanding wine label terms can help you to quickly work out if it’s one you’re likely to enjoy. For instance, certain red grape varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, are notorious for having high tannins and bold flavours, and even more so if they’re from a warm climate region. Or a wine from a particular French appellation will have nuances that are typical of that region.</p>
                        
                        <p>Lighter-coloured red wines tend to be younger wines and are defined as light-bodied or medium-bodied, while deep ruby and garnet red wines are usually medium or full-bodied. Check out our Quick Guide to Red Wine page to find out more.</p>
                        <h4>What are the main types of red wine?</h4>
                        <p>The most popular types of red wine include Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Shiraz, Pinot Noir, Malbec, Zinfandel, Grenache and Sangiovese. Many red wines, such as the famous names we’ve just listed, are referred to by the grape variety from which they are produced. Then, there are other hugely popular types of red wine that are named after the region they’re produced in, rather than their grape variety, such as Rioja.</p>

                    <img class="float-right" src="/assets/images/white-wine.jpg" alt="picture of class with white wine">
                    <p>If you’ve got a soft spot for Sauvignon, Chablis or Sémillon, our white wine guide is for you. From delicate and dry styles to rich and sweet, we cover all the key white wine styles, how white wine is made and other interesting facts in our guide to white wine.</p>
                    <p>White wine is a hugely popular type of wine that’s delicious on its own, ideal for pairing with food, and a great ingredient in cooking for adding flavour, softening meat and creating sauces. If you’ve ever cooked a risotto, you’ll know all about the wonderful ability of wine to make a difference.</p>
                    <p>Just like red wine, there are hundreds of varieties of white wine produced all over the world. Although the majority of them are dry, you’ll often find sweeter varieties of white wine, which is achieved when the winemaker interrupts the process of sugar being turned into alcohol during the fermentation process. Refined at lower temperatures to preserve freshness, white wine is not only light in appearance, but usually refreshing on the palate, too.</p>
                    <p>There are many varieties of white grapes that produce different wine styles depending on where and how they are grown. A French Chardonnay (Chablis), for example, will taste different from a Chardonnay grown in Australia. Regardless of where it is produced, though, a bottle of white wine will generally contain around 300 grapes, with one standard glass of wine containing around 75 grapes.</p>
                    <p>A lot of aspects affect the way a wine tastes, like vintage, growing conditions, winemaker techniques, and the winery itself. So, if you’ve decided you don’t like Chardonnay after a bad experience, it’s always worth trying one from a different area or country, as chances are, the taste will be vastly different.</p>

                        Rosé wines are experiencing a renaissance in the UK and we’re delighted about it! Previously, rosé had widely been considered a summer drink with no real flavour or depth, however the world is starting to open its eyes to the wonderful and varied range of rosé wines now on the market. From France to Italy, USA to New Zealand, there are a number of rosé wines out there that will knock your socks off.
                        
                        For all the basics you need to know about rosé wine, all in one place, this is our handy rosé wine guide.
                        </p>
                    <p>At one point it was considered unfashionable to be seen drinking rosé and the ultimate faux pas was rocking up to a party with a glass of rosé in hand. But thanks to a number of remarkable winemakers the world over, rosé is finally getting the appreciation that it deserves. In fact, back in 2008 sales of rosé wine surpassed that of white wine in France for the first time in history.</p>
                    <p>One of the great aspects of rosé is the vast array of styles it comes in. If you like a good dry rosé perfect for partnering with some Mediterranean cuisine, then look no further than Provence in France. Or, for something a little sweeter, head to California for a White Zinfandel. If sparkling gets you going, then the Champagne region in France produces some of the finest sparkling rosés on the market.</p>
                    <p>You can drink rosé all year around, but the cold refreshing flavour of a good rosé on a hot summer’s day is one of life’s great pleasures.</p>
